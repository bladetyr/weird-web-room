            I live in the United States and in a small house. I have no pets at the moment but I would like a cat one day.
            I also really want to be an artist and I love pencil-focused mediums. That's the inspiration for the colors of this site :)
            also I do web design in my free time but you probably noticed that

            I actually started writing that bio a while ago but I'm gonna finish it now so hello hi I am so tired and I jump at every noise
            I hate it so much. I used to never be this bad but Things Happen. The art is going well though I think I want to go to college
