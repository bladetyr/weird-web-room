            I feel so stupid writing this but I'm just so shaken. I felt my face get burned off. I was in my kitchen and heating up the stove so
            I could start boiling some noodles. I was facing away from the hallway. I suddenly felt something grab the back of my head and slam it into
            the stovetop. I struggled, but I didn't have to struggle for long, because it didn't happen it literally didn't happen. It felt so real
            I genuienly thought my face was going to get burned off. I'm in bed now and I can't sleep. It's been like 4 hours and I have work tomorrow.

            Has anyone else experienced this?? This isn't the first time I've gotten creeped out in my house but this is the first time I felt it
